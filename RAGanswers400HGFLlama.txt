Answer 28: 
 The success of remote preschool learning in crisis zones highlights the potential for technology to bridge the gap in education during times of disruption. However, it is important to recognize that young children require a different type of learning experience than older students, and remote learning may not be suitable for all ages and subjects. The use of sensors in educational settings can be beneficial in some cases, but it is crucial to consider privacy and security concerns when implementing such technology. Ultimately, the key to successful education is providing learning opportunities that are tailored to the needs of each individual child, regardless of their age or location.

Answer 43: 
 Generative AI perpetuates biases by using a small, unrepresentative group as a default for the whole global population in its algorithms, which amplifies societal biases. Expert opinions and research suggest that there are three layers of bias in generative AI: (1) biases baked into the algorithms themselves, (2) biases created by the users of these products, and (3) biases perpetuated by the underrepresented groups themselves.
