 Unterscheidung between structured and unstructured data:

Unstructured data is any information that doesn't fit into a predefined format or structure. This includes text, images, videos, audio files, and other types of media. Unlike structured data, which has a specific format and can be easily searched, analyzed, and processed using machine learning algorithms, unstructured data is more challenging to work with because it lacks a clear organization or hierarchy.
To address this challenge, AI techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and deep learning can be applied to unstruct

In contrast, civilians do not have the same training or authority, and their actions may not be justified when compared to those of a police officer.
In this case, it is possible that the police officer fired at the suspect because they perceived a legitimate threat to themselves or others. For example, if the suspect was armed with
