Answer: 2 
 The potential impacts of the mushroom on the frog's health could be both positive and negative. On one hand, the mushroom could provide a defense mechanism for the frog by creating a barrier against predators or pathogens. On the other hand, if the mushroom grows extensively on the frog's skin or burrows within its body, it could lead to fungal diseases or other adverse health effects. It is important to monitor such occurrences in frog populations because they could provide insights into the frog's immune system and defense mechanisms, as

 Opponents of California's Proposition 1 argue that it could negatively impact mental health programs by taking money away from community-based preventative mental health programs and redirecting it towards locked-door psychiatric institutions and involuntary treatment.

Answer: 134 
 The Biden campaign believes elevating Trump's rhetoric will help them by reminding swing voters of why they turned against him in 2020, potentially pushing them to vote against him again in November. Additionally, by keeping Trump in the media spotlight, the campaign can draw attention away from their own shortcomings and focus on Trump's controversial statements, which could harm his chances with independent voters.

Answer: 239 
 The text does not provide a specific number of deaths caused by the Texas wildfire. However, it mentions that "at least two people" have died and "thousands" of cattle have been killed or will have to be euthanized.

- critics , including big brother watch , argue that such surveillance measures infringe on students ' privacy rights and could foster a mistrustful environment .
Source Document 3:while the technology itself may be benign to some degree , the use of such technology in bathrooms is ripe for abuse . for example , it would n’t be difficult for anyone , student or staff , to partially dismantle such hardware and integrate other equipment , such as cameras and/or microphones .
Source Document 4:in response to the challenges faced by staff with regard to vaping and bullying , some schools across the uk(GPE) have begun to introduce smart sensors into bathrooms that actively listen to students and detect air quality .

Answer: 246 
 Bathrooms are considered prime locations for bullying due to their private nature, which makes it easier for perpetrators to carry out their actions without getting caught. Additionally, the isolation and privacy provided by bathrooms can exacerbate the emotional impact of bullying on victims.
Source Docs:
Source Document 1:to make matters worse , bullies will often look for areas that are secluded and/or private so that they can reduce the chance of getting caught , which makes bathrooms prime locations . due to the private nature of such areas , installing cameras is out of the question , and having staff situated on - site introduces all kinds of privacy issues and impacts the safety of students .
Source Document 2:students and bathrooms – a dangerous mix 

anyone who is reading this article will likely have been a student in a typical school , making friends of all age groups , learning about the wonders of the world , and , from time to time , getting up to no good . but while passing notes in class and making fun of the odd teacher for doing something embarrassing is perfectly normal behaviour , there are other behaviours and traits that are somewhat more concerning .

students and bathrooms – a dangerous mix
Source Document 4:one(CARDINAL) such behaviour is bullying , which itself can be traumatising for those who fall victim to it . in fact , there are countless cases of student suicides and acts of gross violence which directly arise from bullying , hence the importance of stopping bullying in all its forms .

 Big Brother Watch
Source Docs:
Source Document 1:why are such sensors a recipe for disasters ? 

no one can deny that bullying is a disgusting practice and that students , parents , and teachers should do everything they can to identify and stop it . however , there are some lines that should n’t be crossed , and the installation of sensors into private spaces where students are exceptionally vulnerable clearly crosses this line .
Source Document 2:the debate around these sensors is not just about their effectiveness but also their impact on students ' perception of privacy . big brother watch has voiced strong opposition to this approach , labeling it a " gross violation of children 's privacy " ( big brother watch ) . the organisation stresses the importance of safeguarding children 's rights in educational settings , urging schools to seek less intrusive methods for addressing disciplinary issues . this highlights the complex balance schools must navigate between leveraging technology for safety and maintaining a respectful and

Answer: 262 
 Oxybenzone is considered controversial because it can be absorbed by the skin and potentially affect hormone levels in animals, and some research has linked it to hormone/endocrine disruption and lower testosterone levels in adolescent boys, hormone changes in men, and shorter pregnancies and disrupted birth weights in babies.

while the data on how oxybenzone impacts human health is limited , and oversimplifying the science or calling an ingredient " good " or " bad " without a full understanding of the research can lead to misinformation among consumers , whether you choose to use the ingredient depends on your personal preference . sunscreen is a key skin - care product to have in your routine if you want to protect your skin 's health , and the above research has n't been substantial enough for the fda(ORG) to rule oxybenzone sunscreens unsafe to use .

cisa , which has facilitated collusion between big tech companies and federal agencies to flag speech the government disapproves of , does n t just target free speech it claims is false , but also punishes americans(NORP) for   malformation ,   which the agency defines as anything   based on fact , but used out of context to mislead , harm , or manipulate .

Answer: 276 
 True. The press release mentions the partnership with state and federal agencies, including CISA, to mitigate threats to elections.
Source Docs:
Source Document 1:cisa on trial 

curiously , shapiro(PERSON)  s press release did n t explicitly mention cisa  s involvement . the omission comes at the same time that some state election officials , such as west(GPE) virginia(GPE)  s(GPE) secretary of state(ORG) mac(PERSON) warner(PERSON) , have   pulled away   from cisa because   when we have our own federal agencies lying to the american(NORP) people , that  s the most insidious thing that we can do in elections .  
Source Document 2:democratic(NORP) pennsylvania(GPE) gov . josh(PERSON) shapiro(PERSON) announced thursday(DATE) the state would partner with state and federal agencies , including the(ORG) u.s(ORG) .(ORG) department(ORG) of(ORG) homeland(ORG) security(ORG) , to   mitigate threats   to elections , such as speech it deems   misinformation .   the(ORG) pennsylvania(ORG) state(ORG) department(ORG) separately revealed to the federalist that the task force  s cooperation with dhs(ORG) would include   continu[ing ] to work closely   with the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency ( cisa ) .
Source Document 3:cisa has a history of censoring election - related speech 

in working with cisa , pennsylvania(GPE) is partnering with the   nerve center   of the censorship efforts the federal government has weaponized against americans(NORP) and their free speech , including speech about election integrity . shapiro(PERSON) said part of the task force  s mission is to   combat misinformation ,   but cisa has used the   misinformation   smear to wrongfully censor online speech before .
Source Document 4:in an email exchange with the federalist , the(ORG) pennsylvania(ORG) state(ORG) department(ORG) was not immediately forthcoming about the extent of the keystone state  s partnership with cisa   but the agency  s license to censor americans(NORP) in the future hangs on a case that  s currently at the(ORG) supreme(ORG) court(ORG) .

Answer: 322 
 The purpose of TMR-CT is to classify the type of lung cancer patients have by analyzing their metabolomic profiles and deep features of their CT scans. TMR-CT successfully classified lung cancer and gave dependable predictions in relation to patient outcomes, surpassing the performance of traditional CT-based methods and clinical assessments.
